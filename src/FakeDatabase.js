        Title: "SIT102 Learning Report",
        Content: `To demonstrate that I have achieved all the Unit Learning Outcomes for SIT102 – Introduction to Programming to a Distinction level, this portfolio will showcase work that exhibits such a level of standard.

        Coming into this unit, I had a rudimentary understanding of programming but an acute interest in learning more about it. Throughout this unit, I have learnt a wealth of knowledge surrounding core programming concepts, and a deep appreciation for the C++ language. A major milestone for me was using and understanding structures. Previous to this unit, I had learnt of the existence of structures in C++ but knew practically nothing about what exactly they were or how they worked. Diving into what structures are and how to use them was really interesting and I felt more empowered when writing code throughout this unit. A significant hurdle I overcame in this unit was properly using header files and creating my own. As I had briefly experimented with coding prior to this unit, I knew of header files but the concept of linking together multiple files was foreign to me, any code I wrote previously was all in the one file. Exploring exactly how header files work and how they are linked together was really interesting, and being able to write my own was a lot of fun and felt like a huge achievement for me. Now, I feel that I am able to write more decomposed code that is better segmented, and I feel empowered to write my own header files that I can take with me for use in other projects. 
        
        I believe I have achieved a Distinction grade as I have successfully applied all of the Unit Learning Outcomes (ULO) to my work throughout the trimester. This includes, but is not limited to, demonstrating appropriate use of coding conventions, debugging, development and design of procedural programs, effective use of data types and data structures, programming statements, control flow use and modularisation/decomposition of code. Furthermore, my work demonstrates appropriate use of coding terminology, syntax, and critiquing of the quality of my own work.
        
        I have demonstrated ULO 1 in task 5.3C – Game Project (Part 1). A requirement of this task was to review, understand and fix an existing code base that was provided to us. This required us to locate the sections of code that needed fixing, understand how to fix them and to implement our own code while meeting correct coding conventions. The outcome from this was that I successfully fulfilled the task requirements and received approval from the reviewing tutor. Additionally, for task 6.3D – Sort Visualiser, I applied the correct use of coding conventions learnt throughout the unit, including appropriate comments, decomposed coding structure as well as debugging during the development process in order to pass the task.
        
        For ULO 2, I demonstrate this objective in task 7.4D – Custom Program. This task demonstrates appropriate design and developing of a procedural program as the program utilizes effective data types (for example, appropriate data types for variables used within entity structures to track their values),  programming statements that control the actions of the game elements, control flow that determines the actions/outcomes in the game based on conditions, and especially modularisation. The task itself is a demonstration of modularisation as it required a new header file to be created and implemented. Furthermore, the code within the header file is appropriately decomposed by utilizing functions/procedures to group related code together. These artefacts correctly interact with one-another but are also kept separate by the modularisation where necessary. Further to this, task 7.3D – Custom Program Proposal demonstrates my ability to design a program and its components appropriately. In this task, I do this through the use of UML diagrams and explanations on the program’s functionality. 
        
        One task that demonstrated my understanding and application of ULO 3 was task 8.1P – Reading Other Languages. This task required us to read programming languages we had not previously explored in the unit, and to interpret the programming syntax, structure and overall function. To complete this, I had to apply the principles of structured procedural programming in order to understand the overall program flow and function, especially since I didn’t have prior experience with the languages presented. The result of this task was successful as the reviewing tutor marked it as complete. Furthermore, I demonstrate ULO 3 in task 9.4D – Linked Lists. I achieve this by implementing my own code in order to pass the task. To first implement my own code, I needed to understand the syntax related to linked lists/pointers, and the structure of the linked lists. 
        
        For ULO 4, I believe I have successfully fulfilled this objective in several ways. Firstly, many of the weekly tasks required us to reflect on the work we produced and to consider the quality of the work. Specifically for me, task 9.3C – Concept Visualisation required a resubmission as I had produced good visualization and explanation as mentioned by the tutor, but did not provide a sufficient demonstration of real-world use cases for the featured artefacts. The required me to reflect on the work I had produced, and to analyse how to best change it. This resulted in a number of changes being made to the original submission document which resulted in the reviewing tutor approving the work. Another demonstration of ULO 4 is in the periodic Milestone tasks throughout the unit. This required us to reflect on the topics we had learnt and the work we had produced. The Milestone tasks also required us to explore with depth the principles that applied to the concepts we had learnt and how they are best implemented.
